# Instagram Unfollow Tracker

## Overview
**InstaUnfollows** is designed to analyze your Instagram following and identify users you follow but who don't follow you back. The tool was built with Instagram in mind but has the potential to be extended to other social platforms as an "Up Next" feature.

### Key Features
- Allows users to manually remove non followers for better control and customization.
- Currently, the **Choose File** and **Submit** buttons are placeholders, and only a personal Instagram list is being used for testing.
